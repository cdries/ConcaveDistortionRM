# ConcaveDistortionRM

This repository contains the code necessary to replicate the results of the paper ``Upper Bounds for Concave Distortion Risk Measures on Moment Spaces'' by Dries Cornilly, Ludger RÃ¼schendorf and Steven Vanduffel.

The R-file `replicate_paper.R` is organized as to reproduce the different results in each of the relevant subsections of the paper. The functions in `functions_paper` are necessary to obtain the results and need to be sourced, as explained in `replicate_paper.R`.
